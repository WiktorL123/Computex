# Internet Store - MERN Stack Application

## **Overview**

Internet Store is a simulation of an online shopping platform built using the **MERN stack**:
- **MongoDB** for the database,
- **Express.js** for the backend server,
- **React** with **Next.js** for the frontend.

This project aims to provide a realistic simulation of an e-commerce application, showcasing features such as user authentication, product management, cart functionality, and order processing.

---

## **Features**

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for customers.
- **Product Management**: View, filter, and search through a wide range of products.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, update, and remove products from the cart.
- **Order Processing**: Create, confirm, and manage orders.
- **Admin Panel**: For managing products, users, and orders (if implemented).

---

## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**
- **React.js**: For building a dynamic user interface.
- **Next.js**: To handle server-side rendering (SSR) and improve SEO.

### **Backend**
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for server-side JavaScript.
- **Express.js**: A lightweight and flexible backend framework.

### **Database**
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
